In this repo there are 3 different implementations:
```markdown
1. Only backend (main.go): you can play on terminal
2. Fronted (all_frontend): You can in your browser (it's all implemented there, no backend)
2. Site (site): you can play in your browser, running the server to answer your moves (frontend and backend)
```
